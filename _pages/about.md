✨✨✨**I am now on the faculty job market and looking for any academic positions in North America. I sincerely appreciate any help, guidance, and information!**

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the RALI Lab of Université de Montréal. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jian-Yun Nie](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/nie-site/jian-yun-nie-en/). I obtained my Master degree in Computer Science from Université de Montréal, Canada (08.2022) and Bachelor degree from Dalian University of Technology, China (07.2020). 

I have broad interests in Conversational and Interactive AI, Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Multilingualism, User Modeling, and AI for domain applications and social goods.
My future research vision is to develop interactive AI systems that benefit diverse users with effective and efficient interaction between humans and AI assistants, enabling them to achieve their various goals.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](../files/CV.pdf).
